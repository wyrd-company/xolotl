Add an MCP gateway: upstream Streamable HTTP MCP servers from `[mcp.servers]` (several instances of one server with different credentials, header secrets in OpenBao) exposed to clients at `/mcp` as a code-mode MCP server with `search` and `execute` tools. Policies gain the `mcp` scope, `mcp_servers`, `allow_tools` and `deny_tools`. Includes an MCP call log, metrics, `xolotl mcp` commands and an MCP servers page in the web UI.
